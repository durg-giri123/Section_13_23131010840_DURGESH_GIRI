## **ADSA LeetCode Questions - Sem 5**

This repository contains solutions to Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms (ADSA) problems from LeetCode, focused on improving algorithmic problem-solving skills. Each problem is solved using clean, optimized, and well-commented code.

üß∞ ## **Tech Stack & Project Info**

Language & Tools:
Java | IntelliJ IDEA | LeetCode | Git & GitHub

## **Project Objective**:
To practice, understand, and implement advanced DSA concepts through real coding problems:

Solve algorithmically challenging problems from arrays, dynamic programming, and combinatorics.

Write optimized and clean solutions with proper documentation.

Build a collection of reference solutions for sem 5 ADSA course.

## **Features**:

Well-structured solutions with main method for testing.

Inline comments to explain approach and logic.

Problem-specific time & space complexity analysis.

Ready for submission to LeetCode.
